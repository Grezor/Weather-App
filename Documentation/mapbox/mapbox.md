## Mapbox: an alternative to the giant google maps?
Yes, mapbox is an alternative to google maps, but I find that mapbox offers many more services than google maps, just a map.

## Why did you choose mapbox?
The information I want is the contact details of a specific location. 
I chose mapbox because google maps developer (paying). Then what google maps offers are static or dynamic maps.
MapBox has several services, including longitude and altitude coordinates, but also the creation of maps.
