- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Grezor/Weather-App/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
